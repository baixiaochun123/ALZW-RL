ALZW-RL ：“Adaptive LZW Compression with Reinforcement Learning”
We applied reinforcement learning to the LZW algorithm by wrapping the encoder and decoder of the LZW algorithm into an environment. We then trained an agent to learn how to choose actions effectively within this compression environment, while also recording the actions taken. This approach enabled efficient compression and decoding. Compared to the original LZW algorithm, this method shows significant performance improvements.
